            In case you forget, let me gently remind you that you are valuable.
            Every happy moment you bring to others, every smile that brightens a
            room, and every effort you put into whatever you do are all worth
            it. You are worthy of all the hopes you have, all the dreams you
            have, and all the objectives you have set for yourself. Every bit of
            respect you deserve, every act of kindness you perform for others,
            and every ounce of love that wells up from your heart are all worth
            it. You are really so amazing that you are worth everything.
          </p>
          <p className=" text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 lg:text-xl mb-5">
            You are so loved that you should never question your value. The
            people in your immediate vicinity are affected by you. Everywhere
            you go, your special light shines brilliantly, filling the room with
            warmth and happiness. Others are inspired by your fortitude and
            resiliency, and they are moved by your compassion.
          </p>
          <p className=" text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 lg:text-xl mb-5">
            Your successes and faults do not define who you are. Here, now, in
            this moment, you are appreciated for who you are. The world is a
            better place with you in it, and you have so much potential within
            you. Never stop dreaming, never stop shining, and never stop
            realizing how amazing you are.
          </p>
